#Introduction
Mastermind is a game where you guess the pattern color by clicking the mouse

description
in this game, the player guesses the pattern for each line based on the given colors. The computer responds in three ways.

The first is if the color is correct (then the color of the checkbox becomes green).

The second answer is if the color is correct but not in a good location (the checkbox is then yellow)

 he third is if both the color and the position are wrong (the check box is then white colors)

 
if the player makes a mistake 10 times, a message appears and a button to play again

If he hits the pattern, the game stops and the "play again" button appears.
